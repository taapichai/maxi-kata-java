# maxi-kata-java
This Kata is designed to help practice what a test of a pure function ought to look like. It is intentionally designed to start with a very easy, non-branching base case which slowly becomes addled with complexity as additional requirements are added that will require significant branching and eventually a pressure to compose additional units.
